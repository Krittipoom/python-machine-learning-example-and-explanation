# Supervised Learning Techniques
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning in which the algorithm learns to map input features to output labels based on a labeled dataset. Here are some common supervised learning techniques:

# Decision Trees
Decision trees are a type of model that partitions data into smaller subsets based on a series of decisions. They are commonly used for classification and regression tasks.

# k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
k-Nearest Neighbors is a non-parametric model that classifies new data points based on the majority class of its k nearest neighbors. It is commonly used for classification tasks.

# Linear Regression
Linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is commonly used for predicting numerical values.

# Logistic Regression
Logistic regression is a statistical method for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome. It is commonly used for predicting binary outcomes.

# Naive Bayes
Naive Bayes is a probabilistic model that predicts the likelihood of different outcomes based on prior knowledge. It is commonly used for classification tasks.

# Neural Networks
Neural networks are a type of model inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They are commonly used for both classification and regression tasks.

# Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Support vector machines are a type of model that separates data into different classes using a hyperplane. They are commonly used for classification tasks.
