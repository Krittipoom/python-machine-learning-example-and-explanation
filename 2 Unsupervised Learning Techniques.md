# Unsupervised Learning Techniques
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which the algorithm learns to find patterns in unlabeled data. Here are some common unsupervised learning techniques:

# Hierarchical Clustering
Hierarchical clustering is a method of clustering data into groups based on the similarity of the data points. It is commonly used for exploratory data analysis.

# K-Means Clustering
K-Means Clustering is a method of clustering data into k groups based on the similarity of the data points. It is commonly used for exploratory data analysis.

# Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Principal component analysis is a method of reducing the dimensionality of data by identifying the most important features. It is commonly used for exploratory data analysis and data visualization.
